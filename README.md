# GeoSpatial-Data-API
This is for my GeoSpatial Data API Assignment.
<br>

## How to Setup and Run the application:
1. Open the code in your preferred IDE.
2. In the terminal, run "npm run dev" to start your local server.
3. Open Postman and MongoDB.
4. In Postman, import the collection file provided in GitHub.
5. In MongoDB, start a connection to the local server.
6. To run the requests, enter the information needed for the specific request you want (e.g., GET, POST)
7. Follow along with the code to see specific pieces you would need: For example, to get by location, you would need latitude and longitude for the API to get the location you are looking for with the data.
8. Once you POST, check MongoDB to see that your information was added correctly.
9. You must POST before checking for GET all and GET by ID since these pull from MongoDB instead of the external API.
10. Have fun looking at the different weather types happening worldwide!

## Routes and API Used:
The routes used for this project are GET by Location, POST, GET All, and GET by ID. The API used for this project was OpenWeatherMap. No key is needed as one is provided by me for the use of the API, however, that key is not be shared publicly and is hidden.
